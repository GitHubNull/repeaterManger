# HTTP Request History Recording and Database Connection Fixes

## Summary of Changes

### 1. Database Connection Issues Fixed

**Problem**: "数据库连接未初始化或已关闭" errors
**Root Cause**: Race conditions and poor connection management in DatabaseManager

**Fixes Applied**:
- Added thread-safe connection initialization with double-checked locking
- Implemented connection validation and automatic reconnection logic
- Added connection health checks using `isValid()` method
- Added proper error handling and logging

**Key Changes in DatabaseManager.java**:
- Enhanced `getConnection()` method with connection validation and reconnection
- Added `isConnectionValid()` method for connection health checks
- Improved synchronization to prevent race conditions

### 2. HTTP Request History Recording Fixed

**Problem**: HTTP requests not being recorded in history table
**Root Cause**: RequestManager had no history recording logic

**Fixes Applied**:
- Created centralized `HistoryRecordingService` for consistent history recording
- Modified `RequestManager` to automatically record all HTTP requests (success/failure)
- Added request ID tracking to associate history with specific requests
- Implemented async recording to avoid blocking HTTP operations

**Key Changes**:
- **New**: `HistoryRecordingService.java` - Centralized history recording service
- **Modified**: `RequestManager.java` - Added history recording to all request methods
- **Modified**: `EnhancedRepeaterUI.java` - Updated to pass request ID
- **Modified**: `HistoryDAO.java` - Added connection validation and better error handling

## Testing Instructions

### 1. Test Database Connection
1. Start Burp Suite with the extension
2. Check logs for database initialization messages
3. Verify no "数据库连接未初始化或已关闭" errors

### 2. Test HTTP Request History Recording
1. Send an HTTP request through the extension
2. Check if the request appears in the history panel
3. Verify both successful and failed requests are recorded
4. Check logs for history recording messages:
   - `[+] HTTP请求历史记录已保存，ID: X` for successful requests
   - `[+] HTTP失败请求历史记录已保存，ID: X` for failed requests

### 3. Test Database Recovery
1. Simulate database connection issues (if possible)
2. Verify the extension can recover and continue recording history
3. Check that requests still work even if history recording fails

### 4. Test Request ID Association
1. Create/save a request in the request list
2. Send that request
3. Verify the history record shows the correct request ID association

## Expected Behavior

1. **All HTTP requests** (successful or failed) should be recorded in history
2. **No database connection errors** should appear in logs
3. **History records** should include proper request details (method, URL, status code, etc.)
4. **Request ID association** should work when sending requests from the request list

## Logging Messages to Look For

### Success Indicators:
- `[+] 数据库连接重新建立成功` - Database connection restored
- `[+] HTTP请求历史记录已保存，ID: X` - Successful request recorded
- `[+] HTTP失败请求历史记录已保存，ID: X` - Failed request recorded
- `[+] 历史记录已保存，ID: X` - History saved successfully

### Error Indicators (should be rare now):
- `[!] 保存历史记录失败: 数据库连接无效` - Database connection issue
- `[!] 历史记录任务队列已满，无法添加任务` - Recording service overloaded

## Rollback Plan

If issues occur, you can revert to the previous version by:
1. Restoring the original DatabaseManager.java
2. Removing the HistoryRecordingService.java
3. Restoring the original RequestManager.java
4. Restoring the original EnhancedRepeaterUI.java

The changes are backward compatible and should not affect existing functionality.
